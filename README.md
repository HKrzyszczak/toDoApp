# ToDo App Example + localStorage

This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Demo build with github pages:
[toDoApp](https://HKrzyszczak.github.io/toDoApp)

## After clone or download 

In the project directory, to download all modules and dependencies, write to the console:
### `npm install` 

We do this only once after downloading or updating project files.

After this and in the future, to run a local development server, you must enter and execute the command:
### `npm start` 

This will launch applications in the default browser in the development mode.
In the event of accidental closing, you can enter the address:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser. 

The page will reload if you make edits and save changes.
